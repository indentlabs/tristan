# Tristan (bot)

A Discord bot.

## Using the bot

Type `/generate character` to start your template. From there, just select which character fields you'd like to add to your template. After you've built your template, a character will automatically be created using it!

After any character is generated, you can click the "Generate another character with this template" button to instantly create additional characters using the same template, or click the "Use a new template" button to start building a new template to generate from.

## Have feedback? Suggestions?

I'd love to hear them [here](https://github.com/indentlabs/tristan/issues) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uM6EHxkeUX) -- whatever is convenient for you! I'll be adding more generators and expanding the functionality of existing generators over time, so I'd love to hear about what's helpful, what's not, and what else you wish the bot could generate.

Thanks!
